-> memory space,big-o notation.

-> take input in a and b and store its addition to c varuble so here a and b are auxilary space and c is input space.
-> int a[n] here SC is O(n).
-> never do anything to the input unles the interviewer sees.
-> never do like take input a and b and store in variable b itself iy will reduce space but not a good.
-> most of the servers of like leetcode,gfg takes 1s~~ 10^8 opertaions.
-> 2s means 2 * 10^8 operaions
-> 5s means 5 * 10^8 ope.
